# Wordsearch
A twist on the word search game. 
Instead of words to search for, players are given questions to answer and then they try to find the answer in the grid.
The player plays against a timer, if they find all answers in the grid within the time the round ends and a new word search quiz is started. 
Periodically the difficulty of the game is increased in terms of number of answers to find and size of grid hiding the answers.
